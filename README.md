# ProEngulfing Forex Trading Robot

This code is a sample implementation of the ProEngulfing Forex Trading Robot, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This robot is designed to generate trading signals based on the engulfing pattern in the Forex market.

## How it Works

1. Necessary Libraries and Dependencies:
   - The code includes the necessary libraries and dependencies, such as iostream, vector, and cmath.

2. Constants and Variables:
   - The code defines several constants and variables that can be customized according to user preferences. These include the entry threshold, exit threshold, stop loss level, take profit level, and position size.

3. Generating Trading Signals:
   - The `generateSignals` function takes a vector of historical prices as input and returns a vector of trading signals.
   - It iterates through the prices and identifies engulfing patterns based on the current, previous, and previous previous candlestick prices.
   - If a bullish engulfing pattern is detected, a buy signal is generated. If a bearish engulfing pattern is detected, a sell signal is generated. Otherwise, no signal is generated.

4. Executing Trades:
   - The `executeTrades` function takes the generated signals as input and executes trades accordingly.
   - It maintains a current price, current position, current stop loss, and current take profit level.
   - For each signal, it checks if the current position needs to be closed or a new position needs to be opened based on the signal type (buy or sell).
   - It also checks if the stop loss or take profit levels are hit, and closes the position if necessary.

5. Main Function:
   - The main function initializes a vector of historical prices and calls the `generateSignals` and `executeTrades` functions.
   - It can be modified to use real-time market prices and interact with a trading platform.
